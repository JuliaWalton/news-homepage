## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of building responsive nav bars along with being nice layout practice.

```js
const media = window.matchMedia("(width < 800px)");

function setupNav(e) {
  if (e.matches) {
    // console.log('is mobile');
    nav.className = "nav";
    sidebarBtn.style.display = "flex";
    console.log(nav.className);
  } else {
    // console.log('is desktop');
    nav.className = "desktop-nav";
    sidebarBtn.style.display = "none";
  }
}
```
